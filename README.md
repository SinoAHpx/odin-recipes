# Odin-Recipes

This project is my very first step on coding a web page, as it is a part of the curriculum in [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#be-careful-about-creating-files-on-github). Searching for the repo name, many people just like me, who just got into the world of front end development, did the exactly same thing.

Yeah, so I made this repository, as if I created a monument.
