    <h1>Braised pork</h1>
    <img src="../img/braised-pork.webp" alt="An authentic braised pork">
    <p>It must have been the subliminal beer and liquor advertising that got me, because I wasn't even thinking about Cinco de Mayo when I decided to make this milk-braised pork carnitas recipe. The milk braising beforehand seems to give the meat a little extra succulence. The subtle sweetness from the orange is also very nice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into large pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 orange, juiced and zested</li>
        <li> 2 cups whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season pork with pepper and salt.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in large pot over high heat. Working in batches, cook pork in the hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Return all cooked pork and accumulated juice to pot.</li>
        <li>Season pork with bay leaves, cumin, dried oregano, and cayenne pepper. Stir in fresh orange juice, orange zest, and milk. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is fork tender but not falling apart, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove pork from liquid. Skim some fat from the pot to grease a baking dish. Transfer the pieces of pork to the baking dish. Drizzle about 2 more tablespoons of the floating fat over the meat. Season with more salt, if needed.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until pork is browned, about 15 minutes. Stir pork.</li>
        <li>Turn on oven's broiler. Cook pork under broiler until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
